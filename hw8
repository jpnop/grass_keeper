the revised text

The format of each line in the map is defined by the following rule:

source_word: target_word

- Do NOT ignore case or punctuation marks. The sentences are case-sensitive.
- In a line, words are separated by white spaces

You must use a "Binary Search Tree (BST)" to create the map for the map.txt files.

Use the source word as the key and target word as the value.
